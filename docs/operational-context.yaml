    issue: "Out of Memory (OOMKilled)"
    app: "my-payment-api"
    environment: "prod"
    root_cause: "Memory limit set to 512Mi but app needs 1Gi under load"
    
  - date: "2024-01-20"
    issue: "High CPU throttling"
    app: "my-payment-api"
    environment: "prod"
    root_cause: "CPU limit too low (500m) during peak traffic"
    
  - date: "2024-01-25"
    issue: "Pod startup failures"
    app: "my-payment-api"
    environment: "prod"
    root_cause: "Readiness probe failing - app takes 45s to start"

resource_observations:
  patterns:
    - "Payment APIs typically need 2x memory during month-end processing"
    - "API services should have readiness probe delay >= startup time"
    - "Production workloads should never run with limits == requests"
    - "HPA should target 70% CPU to allow burst capacity"
    
  recommendations:
    - "Set memory requests to 80% of observed usage"
    - "Set memory limits to 150% of observed peak usage" 
    - "Use multiple replicas for high availability"
    - "Enable HPA for variable workloads"
    - "Set conservative probe timeouts in production"
